I'm bad at keeping things organized in my brain parts, and my hands melt paper, so I got together with a *very* generous, and patient synthetic super-intelligence to build a system I could use to document my little projects.

## What is this?

This is a Streamlit-shell stuffed with Python, JSON, and markdown files to allow for a relatively simple-to-update Content-Management-System (CMS), without having to rely on other documentation offerings that force me to remember they exist.

I can run this locally, as well as hosting it via the Streamlit Community cloud via GitHub, and all through the comfort of VSCode as my text editor.

And look, I can make little tables here:

| CMS Options   | Mine      | Makes Me Happy?   |
| :---          |    :----: |     :----: |
| Notion        | ❌        | 😞        |
| Obsidian      | ❌        | 😞        |
| Confluence    | ❌        | 😞        |
| Microsoft 365 | ❌        | 😞        |
| G-Suite       | ❌        | 😞        |
| Mine          | ✅        | 😍        |

Wow! If that isn't enough proof then I don't know what to tell you.
